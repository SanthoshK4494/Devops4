MECHANICAL WATCHES
Mechanical movements never require batteries because they require periodical hand-winding to operate. They are accurate to about +/- 20 seconds a day and super reliable and just plain cool to look at. They justify a higher price tag than other movements because they feature intricate series of tiny components that work together to power the timepiece.

AUTOMATIC WATCHES
Automatic watches are self-winding with a spring inside, there is no battery and very little maintenance is required for this type of watch. Automatic watches capture the movement of your wrist and use it to power the mechanism so there is no need to wind the watch by hand, or buy batteries. They are accurate to about +/- 20 seconds a day and available for all budgets.

QUARTZ WATCHES
Quartz watches are a type of watch that runs on an electric current, which comes from a battery in the watch. They require a battery to function & battery replacement every 2-3 years. Quartz watches are one of the most popular types of watch and many people prefer them over mechanical watches. They are one of the most affordable watch movements and are accurate to about +/- 15 seconds a month. 

SOLAR WATCHES
Solar watches are powered by light, which is converted into energy. They use a battery that stores this energy and then powers the watch. There are two types of solar watches: primary and secondary. A primary solar watch converts light into energy and if there's no light, the watch will stop. A secondary solar movement has a rechargeable re-chargeable battery in addition to the solar cell so that even if its not exposed to light for some time, you can still wear your watch for quite some time without issue. They are accurate to about +/- 15 seconds a month and offer something completely different.
